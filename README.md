# OnlineLearningPlatform

OnlineLearningPlatform is a Django-based web application that allows instructors to create courses and lessons, and students to enroll in courses and track their progress.

## Features

1. Project Structure:
   - Created a Django project with two main apps: 'courses' and 'accounts'

   - Extended UserCreationForm for custom signup with email
   - Implemented login, logout, and registration views
   - Used @login_required decorator for access control

3. Models (courses/models.py):
   - Course: Represents a course with title, description, and instructor (ForeignKey to User)
   - Lesson: Represents individual lessons within a course (ForeignKey to Course)
   - Enrollment: Manages student enrollment in courses (Many-to-Many relationship between User and Course)
   - Progress: Tracks student progress in lessons (ForeignKey to User and Lesson)

4. Views (courses/views.py):

   - Utilized template inheritance for consistent layout across pages

6. Forms (accounts/forms.py, courses/forms.py):
   - Created custom forms for user registration and course/lesson creation
   - Utilized Django's ModelForm for automatic form generation based on models

7. URL Configuration:
   - Set up URL patterns in both project-level and app-level urls.py files

8. Admin Interface:
   - Registered models in admin.py for easy backend management
   - Customized admin views for better data representation and management

9. Custom Template Tags:

    - Used Django's authentication system for secure user management
    - Implemented permission checks in views to ensure data privacy

12. User Roles:
    - Differentiated between instructor (staff) and student (non-staff) users
